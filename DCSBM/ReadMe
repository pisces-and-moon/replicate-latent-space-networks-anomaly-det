The degree corrected stochastic block model (DCSBM) is borrowed from the paper
M. J. Zhao, A. R. Driscoll, S. Sengupta, N. T. Stevens, R. D. Fricker Jr, and W. W. H. Theeffect of temporal aggregation level in social network monitoring.PloS One, 13, 2018.
The Simulation Functions.R is borrowed from their github repository. The files first simulated a DCSBM network data based on the paper. Then our method is run on the simulated data and
the results are plotted.
